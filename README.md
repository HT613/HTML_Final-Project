# webdev_project3

This is my third project for my HTML class utilizing JavaScript and CSS. In this project, I learned to utilize Google Maps API to set a sample location, as well as work with mobile-first design and interactivity. 

My favorite part of this project was getting to play around with css reset and javascript code, which was initially very difficult for me to comprehend.
